To approach a data analytics project from a business perspective, first step is to understand the business's goals and objectives.

Understanding Business needs:
  - what is the business trying to achieve?
  - identify the key stakeholders and understand pain points.
  - to understand KPIs
  - to understand who will be the target audience.

In terms of gathering Requirements:
  - need to have few open ended questions like: 
      - what business questions we have to answer with our data?
      - what data sources we already have and any new data source required
      - what type of data will be received by us?
      - is it batch or streaming or both?
      - if its batch how often we receive data?
      - do we have BI application at the end which we pull data from a warehouse
      - what data architecture we will go about ?
